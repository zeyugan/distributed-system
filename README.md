# distributed-system
In this project, you are asked to design and implement a system for remote file 
access based on client-server architecture. The files are stored on the local disk of 
the server. The server program implements a set of services for clients to remotely 
access the files. Meanwhile, the client program provides an interface for users to 
invoke these services. On receiving a request input from the user, the client sends 
the request to the server. The server performs the requested service and returns the 
result to the client. The client then presents the result on the console to the user. The 
client-server communication is carried out using UDP.
